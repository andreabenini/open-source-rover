\section{Flashing the Arduino Code}

In this section we will be flashing the code that runs on the arduino to control the LED matrix in the head. The following steps should be performed on your laptop or development machine (not the raspberry pi)

\begin{enumerate} 
\item Install the Arduino IDE used for loading code onto the arduino:

	\href{https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software}{https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software}

\item Clone the code repo:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item git clone https://github.com/nasa-jpl/osr-rover-code.git
	\item git checkout osr-ROS
	\item git pull
	\end{enumerate}

\item Build our custom library:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Select the downloaded Arduino folder and create a .ZIP file from it
	\item Rename the Zip file to OsrScreen.zip
	\end{enumerate}

\item Load the sketch onto the Arduino
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Unplug the Arduino shield JST cable so the Arduino isn't powered by the control board
	\item Connect the Arduino to your development machine with USB cable
	\item Open Arduino IDE
	\item Select Sketch - Include Library - Add .Zip Library 
	\item Select the OsrScreen.zip folder created previously
	\item Click the Upload button in the Sketch Window	
	\end{enumerate}

\item To load the example in the Arduino IDE: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item File - Examples - OsrScreen - OsrScreen 
	\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Setting up the Raspberry Pi 3}
In this section, we'll go over setting up the Raspberry Pi and setting up all the code that will run the rover. Our rover uses ROS (Robotic Operating System), which will be installed on the Raspbian operating system; we will set up both of these below.  We will also set up the bluetooth pairing from the android device.

\subsection{Getting the Raspberry Pi running}
The first step is to install Raspbian on your Raspberry Pi. To install Raspbian,
we recommend following the "Getting started with Raspberry Pi" tutorial below.  \textbf{**NOTE: These instructions were tested and verified using Raspbian Stretch.  Newer versions of Raspbian (such as Buster) may cause complications with these instructions.  We therefore recommend installing Raspbian Stretch instead of the latest/default version of Raspbian, which the tutorial below will recommend.  Do not flash NOOBS onto your card; instead download the Raspbian Streth image below and skip the NOOBS step in the tutorial.}  In addition, we have created a pre-built image with both Raspbian Stretch and ROS already installed.  You can download this image as a last resort if you can't get Raspbian and ROS installed and working on your own, but please note that you will miss out on some the learning opportunities that come with debugging a software installation by doing so.  

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[] Tutorial for installing the latest version of Raspbian on a new Raspberry Pi:
	\item[] \href{https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-getting-started}{https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-getting-started}
	\item[] Direct downloadable Raspbian Stretch image: 
	\item[] \href{https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2019-04-09/2019-04-08-raspbian-stretch.zip}{https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2019-04-09/2019-04-08-raspbian-stretch.zip}
	\item[] Custom JPL image with both Raspbian Stretch and ROS pre-built:
	\item[] \href{https://drive.google.com/open?id=18Tzx2tzmwUHOpBue-Hew3XYpXZIEQpiF}{https://drive.google.com/open?id=18Tzx2tzmwUHOpBue-Hew3XYpXZIEQpiF}
	\item[] \textbf{**NOTE: If you install the Custom JPL image with Raspbian Stretch and ROS pre-built, skip to step 2.4.} 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Once you finish the above tutorial and install Raspbian Stretch, you should be able to boot your Raspberry Pi and see a desktop!

\subsection{Installing ROS}
If you do not download the pre-built Raspbian Stretch / ROS image above, you will need to build ROS yourself:

First, make sure you update all the packages on your pi:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{sudo apt-get update}
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{sudo apt-get upgrade}
\end{itemize} 
(The above commands may take a few minutes to run.)

Next, we will install ROS (and specifically, the version called 'Kinetic').  To install ROS, follow the installation instructions at:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[] \href{http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Kinetic%20on%20the%20Raspberry%20Pi}{http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing\%20ROS\%20Kinetic\%20on\%20the\%20Raspberry\%20Pi}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Setting up serial communication}	

In this project we will be using serial communication to talk to the motor controllers. Serial communication is a communication protocol that describes how bits of information are transferred between one device and another. You can find more information on serial communication at:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-communication}{https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-communication}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Run the following commands on the Pi to setup/enable the serial communication for the RoboClaws:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{sudo raspi-config}
\end{itemize}

\noindent In the raspi-config menu, set the following options:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-]  Interface Options $-> $ Serial 
	\item[-] Would you like a login shell to be accessible over serial? $->$ No
	\item[-] Would you like the serial port hardware to be enabled? $->$ Yes
	\item[-] Would you like to reboot now? $->$ Yes
\end{itemize} 
\noindent Once the Pi reboots, open up a terminal again and look at the serial devices:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{ls -l /dev/serial*}
\end{itemize}
Make sure that this shows serial0 -$>$ ttyS0 . If it does not, ensure that you have followed every step in this tutorial in order. Next, edit the /boot/cmdline.txt file:
\begin{itemize}
	\item [] \colorbox{lightgray}{sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Change \textbf{ONLY} the part with "console = ...." to read "console=tty1" and remove any other instance where it references console. The first bit of that line should look similar to the Figure \ref{console}: \footnote{It is okay if it does not exactly match what we show here; the important part is that the "console=tty1" flag matches.}

\begin{figure}[H]
 	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{"Pictures/console".PNG}
 	\caption{boot/cmdline.txt File}
	\label{console}
\end{figure}

\noindent Below is a link to help with the above steps if you need additional help:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://spellfoundry.com/2016/05/29/configuring-gpio-serial-port-raspbian-jessie-including-pi-3/}{https://spellfoundry.com/2016/05/29/configuring-gpio-serial-port-raspbian-jessie-including-pi-3/}. 
\end{itemize}
\noindent Once you've completed the above steps, reboot the Pi.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{sudo reboot}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Downloading the Rover Code}
On the Raspberry Pi, open up a terminal \textbf{(ctl + alt + t)} and then type the following commands\footnote{In this document, terminal commands will be \colorbox{lightgray}{highlighted}.}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[] Move to your home directory: \colorbox{lightgray}{cd /home/pi}
	\item[] Clone the rover code repository: \colorbox{lightgray}{git clone https://github.com/nasa-jpl/osr-rover-code osr}
	\item[] Move into the directory you just cloned: \colorbox{lightgray}{cd osr}
	\item[] Pull to make sure you have the latest code: \colorbox{lightgray}{git pull}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Building the Rover Code to work with your ROS installation}
Now, you must build the rover code packages so that ROS can run them on your Raspberry Pi.  To do this, run the following commands in a terminal:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[] Create a catkin workspace directory and move into it:
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{mkdir -p /home/pi/osr\_ws/src \&\& cd /home/pi/osr\_ws}
	\item[] Build a basic, empty catkin project: \colorbox{lightgray}{catkin\_make}
	\item[] Move to the directory containing the main OSR logic: \colorbox{lightgray}{cd /home/pi/osr/ROS}
	\item[] Copy the OSR source files to the catkin workspace:
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{mv led\_screen/ osr/ osr\_bringup/ osr\_msgs/ /home/pi/osr\_ws/src}
	\item[] Make all of the source files executable:  \colorbox{lightgray}{cd /home/pi/osr\_ws/src/osr/scripts \&\& chmod +x *.py}
	\item[] Move back to your catkin workspace: \colorbox{lightgray}{cd /home/pi/osr\_ws}
	\item[] Build the sensor\_msgs ROS package:
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{\parbox{0.9\textwidth}{rosinstall\_generator sensor\_msgs --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar \textgreater kinetic-sensor\_msgs-wet.rosinstall}}
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{wstool init src kinetic-sensor\_msgs-wet.rosinstall}
	\item[] Run a "catkin make" of the OSR workspace (this will take some time): \colorbox{lightgray}{catkin\_make}
\end{itemize}

\noindent If your catkin make command succeeded, you should now see new build/ and devel/ directories in /home/pi/osr\_ws.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[] Source your newly created ROS environment: 
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash}
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{source /home/pi/osr\_ws/devel/setup.bash}
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{source /home/pi/osr\_ws/devel/setup.sh}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Use nano (or your editor of choice) to add the above three 'source' commands to the end of your $\sim$/.bashrc file, each on its own line.  This will allow you to re-launch the OSR code without needing to source the OSR ROS environment each time:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{sudo nano $\sim$/.bashrc}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Running the Rover Code Manually}
At this point, all the code should be ready to run on your rover!  You can start the rover code by running the following command in a terminal:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] Run the roslaunch command (read more about roslaunch at \href{http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch}{http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch}):
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{roslaunch osr\_bringup osr.launch}
\end{itemize}

\noindent You should now see the rover trying to launch all its ROS "nodes", which are the various parts of the robot that all communicate to each other.  Figure \ref{ros architecture} shows more information about the ROS ecosystem on this rover:
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{"Pictures/ROS_architecture".PNG}
	\caption{OSR ROS Architecture}
	\label{ros architecture}
\end{figure}

You can find more details about the software / ROS architecture in the README document in the osr-rover-code repository at \href{https://github.com/nasa-jpl/osr-rover-code/tree/osr-ROS}{https://github.com/nasa-jpl/osr-rover-code/tree/osr-ROS}.

\bigskip 

\noindent If you wish to control the rover in any manner other than with an Xbox controller, you can do so by publishing commands onto the "/joystick" topic using the Joystick message type from osr\_msgs. To do this, you would simply write a ROS node to read in whatever control method you wish and output a corresponding Joystick message. The rover's ROS ecosystem will see these Joystick messages and drive the rover based on your commands!

\subsection{Init Script}

Starting scripts on boot using ROS can be a little more difficult than starting scripts on boot normally from the Raspberry Pi because of the default permission settings on the RPi and the fact that that ROS cannot be ran as the root user. The way that we will starting our rover code automatically on boot is to create a service that starts our roslaunch script, and then automatically run that service on boot of the robot. Further information on system service scripts running at boot can be found at: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://www.linode.com/docs/quick-answers/linux/start-service-at-boot/}{https://www.linode.com/docs/quick-answers/linux/start-service-at-boot/}. 
\end{itemize}

There are two scripts in the "Software/Init Scripts" folder. The first is the bash file that runs the roslaunch file, and the other creates a system service to start that bash script. Open up a terminal on the raspberry Pi and execute the following commands.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{cd /home/pi/osr/Init\textbackslash\ Scripts}
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{sudo cp LaunchOSR.sh /usr/bin/LaunchOSR.sh}
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/LaunchOSR.sh}
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{sudo cp osr\_startup.service /etc/systemd/system/osr\_startup.service}
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/osr\_startup.service}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Your osr\_startup service is now installed on the Pi and ready to be used. The following are some commands related to managing this service which you might find useful:

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
		\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
		\hline
		\textbf{Desciption} & \textbf{Command} \\ \hline
		Start service & sudo systemctl start osr\_startup.service \\ \hline
		Stop service & sudo systemctl stop osr\_startup.service \\ \hline
		Enable service (runs on boot of RPi) & sudo systemctl enable osr\_startup.service \\ \hline
		Disable service (doesn't run on boot of RPi) & sudo systemctl disable osr\_startup.service \\ \hline
		Check status of service & sudo systemctl status osr\_startup.service \\ \hline
		View live service list & sudo journalctl -f \\ \hline
		\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Note: We do not recommend enabling the service until you have verified that everything on your robot runs successfully manually.  Once you enable the service, as soon as you power on the RPi it will try and run everything. This could cause issues if everything has not yet been fully tested and verified. Additionally, if you are doing development of your own software for the robot we suggest disabling the service and doing manual launch of the scripts during testing phases. This will help you more easily debug any issues with your code.} Once you have fully tested the robot and made sure that everything is running correctly by starting the rover code manually via \colorbox{lightgray}{roslaunch osr\_bringup osr.launch}, enable the startup service on the robot with the command below:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \colorbox{lightgray}{sudo systemctl enable osr\_startup.service}
\end{itemize}

At this point, your rover should be fully functional and automatically run whenever you boot it up!  Congratulations and happy roving!!
